tinyalsa: a small library to interface with ALSA in the Linux kernel

The aims are:

- Provide a basic pcm and mixer API
- If it's not absolutely needed, don't add it to the API
- Avoid supporting complex and unnecessary operations that could be
  dealt with at a higher level

tinyalsa-ndk: a slightly modified tinyalsa lib to make it compile using android-ndk - especially the tinymix utility.

- This repo also holds the precompiled binaries (compiled with ndk) of tinymix and related utils in the libs/armeabi/ directory.
